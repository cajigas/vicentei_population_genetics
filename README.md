# vicentei_population_genetics
We aim to assess assess genetic diversity, population structure, and historical effective population size across populations of Oophaga vicentei with different color morphs, using SNPs from transcriptomic data.

Bioinformatic pipeline and population genetics analysis were conducted following https://github.com/cajigas/granulifera_selection.git, just adjusting the scripts for corresponding sample sizes and names.
