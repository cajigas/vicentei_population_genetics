# vicentei_population_genetics
Oophaga vicentei, endemic to central Panama, exhibits striking color polymorphism and faces strong pressures from habitat fragmentation and illegal collection. Despite being Endangered, little is known about its populations genetic structure and demographic history. 
In this study we aim to assess assess genetic diversity, population structure, and historical effective population size across populations of Oophaga vicentei with different color morphs, using SNPs from transcriptomic data. 

Bioinformatic pipeline and population genetics analysis were conducted following https://github.com/cajigas/granulifera_selection, just adjusting the scripts for corresponding sample sizes and names.

Demographic analyses were conducted by Ariel Rodríguez, using ANGSD and Stairway plot, and scripts can be found in the repository:
